## Guidelines

### Workflow

We use the
[Feature Branch Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)
and review all changes we merge to master.

### Commit Message

Commit messages shall follow the conventions defined by [conventional-changelog](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

#### What to use as scope

In most cases the changed component is a good choice as scope
e.g. if the change is done in the MindConnectAgent  the scope should be *Agent*.

### Code Style

Please follow the typescript code style which is established in tslint.json. (Works out of the box in many editors, e.g. Visual Studio Code)

## 3.7.0 (Vienna Ocelots) - April 2020

- the old 0.20.* based docker images are now deprecated
- the node has now a link to agent diagnostic application in the mindsphere
- new configuration button to delete all local data of the agent (including the .mc/agentconfig.json)
- the node will await parallel asynchronous requests automatically after configured number of seconds
- the node will regularly display information about asynchronous requests

### Important docker image user change - for users upgrading from versions before 3.7.0

If you are using host directories for docker persistence and you are upgrading from previous version of docker images (which were based on 0.20.* version of node red) you will have to ensure that any existing data and .mc directory has the correct ownership.
As of 1.0 this needs to be 1000:1000. This can be forced by running the command

```bash
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 path/to/your/node-red/data
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 path/to/your/node-red/data/.mc
```

on the host system.

Consider using docker named volumes instead.

This is necessary because of the change in the base docker image of node-red. See also <https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/docker>

## Bugfixes 3.7.0

- the node now removes previous keep alive and async logging interval on redeployement (#39)
- fixed CSS for node-red > 1.0.0 (the node title is white again)
- updated to mindconnect-nodejs 3.7.0
